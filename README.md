Mod Information
=======
This mod serves to provide various updates to how the End works.

Currently, the mod only makes it so that if the Exit Portal spawns in a  
location where there aren't any blocks, instead of only generating the 
center bedrock pillar and it's torches at the bottom of the world, it 
instead generates the end portal at a Y height of 64.

This mod is primarily meant to serve as a companion mod to the adjusted End
generation that the respective world expansion data pack has, since said
data pack can result in the 0,0 coordinate not having any blocks.
